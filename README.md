# Drum-Machine :musical_note:

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp's Front End Certification.
It was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Functionality :white_check_mark:

-  When I press the trigger key associated with each drum-pad, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered (e.g. pressing the Q key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string Q, pressing the W key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string W, etc.).

- When a drum-pad is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the display element (each string must be unique).
